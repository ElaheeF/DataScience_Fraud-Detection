# DataScience_Fraud-Detection
Working on financial datasets for fraud detection is important because financial fraud can have serious consequences for individuals and businesses, including financial losses, legal and regulatory sanctions, damage to reputation, and loss of customer trust. By developing effective fraud detection models using financial data, organizations can detect fraudulent activity early and prevent further losses. Fraud detection is an important aspect of banking and financial companies. Itâ€™s essential for both financial institutions as well as their customers to be able to identify fraud quickly and accurately. objective is to build a predictive model to determine whether a given transaction will be fraud or not. Financial datasets are important to many researchers and in particular to us performing research in the domain of fraud detection. Part of the problem is the intrinsically private nature of financial transactions, that leads to no publicly available datasets.

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants. The goal of the project is to build a model that allows to identify a fraudulent transaction.
